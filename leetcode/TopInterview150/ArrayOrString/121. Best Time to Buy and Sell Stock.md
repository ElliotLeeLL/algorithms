### [121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return *the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction*. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```



**Constraints:**

- `1 <= prices.length <= 105`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 104`



**Time Limit Exceeded**❌

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int n = prices.length;
        // Max array records maximum profit for each element in prices
        int[] max = new int[n];

        // Iterate all elements in prices
        for(int i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
            // Update max array
            for(int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if(prices[i] - prices[j] > max[j]) {
                    max[j] = prices[i] - prices[j];
                }
            }
        }

        return Arrays.stream(max).max().getAsInt();
    }
}
```



**Greedy algorithm**

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int profit = 0;
        int min = prices[0];
        
        for(int price : prices) {
            if(price < min) {
                min = price;
            }
            if(price - min > profit) {
                profit = price - min;
            }
        }
        
        return profit;
    }
}
```
