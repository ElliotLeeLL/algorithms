### [122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/)

You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold **at most one** share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the **same day**.

Find and return *the **maximum** profit you can achieve*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Total profit is 4.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 104`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 104`



```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if(prices.length == 1) return 0;
        int profit = 0;
        
        for(int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            profit = Math.max(profit, profit + (prices[i] - prices[i-1]));
        }
        
        return profit;
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

This is adynamic programming problem. For each price in prices array, you could sell the stock purchased at the the previous price or do nothing and retain the profit. This strategy maximizes profit by ensuring that you buy and sell the stock when you could gain profit.

Another important point to mention is that you can still achieve the maximum profit, whether you choose smaller or larger profits along the way. For example, consider prices [1, 2, 3]. The profit is the same whether you buy the stock at prices 1 and 2, selling it at prices 2 and 3, or simply buy it at 1 and sell it at 3.
