### [135. Candy](https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/)

There are `n` children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array `ratings`.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

- Each child must have at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return *the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == ratings.length`
- `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`
- `0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 104`



```java
class Solution {
    public int candy(int[] ratings) {
        int n = ratings.length;
        int total = n;
        int curPeak = 0;
        int curValley = 0;
        
        int i = 1;
        
        while(i < n) {
            while(ratings[i] == ratings[i - 1]) {
                i++;
            }
            
            curPeak = 0;
            while(i < n && ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]) {
                curPeak++;
                total += curPeak;
                i++;
            }
            
            if(i == n - 1) {
                return total;
            }
            
            curValley = 0;
            while(i < n && ratings[i] < ratings[i - 1]) {
                curValley++;
                total += curValley;
                i++;
            }
            
            total -= Math.min(curPeak, curValley);
        }
        
        return total;
    }
}
```



**Explanation**

This is a challenging leetcode question, to be honest, I didn't solve it myself. The trick for this question is that ratings array will always get through crest and trough. Therefore, we could simulate this process, and gradually accumulate and add up curPeak and curValley values as:

> Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors. 

At the last of each loop, remember to compensate the total with minimal value between curPeak and curValley, cause the next start point should be allocated with one candy.
