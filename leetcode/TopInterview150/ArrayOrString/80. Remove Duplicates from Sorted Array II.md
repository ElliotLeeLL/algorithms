#### [80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array-ii/)

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove some duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each unique element appears **at most twice**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the **first part** of the array `nums`. More formally, if there are `k` elements after removing the duplicates, then the first `k` elements of `nums` should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first `k` elements.

Return `k` *after placing the final result in the first* `k` *slots of* `nums`.

Do **not** allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by **modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** with O(1) extra memory.

**Custom Judge:**

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

```
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
```

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be **accepted**.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
Output: 5, nums = [1,1,2,2,3,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3]
Output: 7, nums = [0,0,1,1,2,3,3,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
- `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
- `nums` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.



```java
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        int head = 2;
        int rear = 2;
        
        while(rear < nums.length){
            if(nums[head - 2] != nums[rear]) {
                nums[head] = nums[rear];
                head++;
            }
            rear++;
        }
        
        return head;
    }
}
```

**Explanations**

The first point head is used to indicate the element to be modified, and the rear variable points to the current value. For each loop, you should check if the elements pointed by (head - 2) and rear are equal, if they are, you should update the element pointed by head and move these two point forward. Just remember that all the elements before head point are processed and the head point indicate the element to be processed.
